# **API with Django 3**

## In this project, one API in Django Rest Framework were built and the objective was to create a school system, it's possible to create students, delete students, edit students, and same way it's possible to create courses and make all changes that need or want. One system of registration was made to make a bridge between the students and the courses that they are registered.
